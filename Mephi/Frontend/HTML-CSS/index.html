                    On Saturday the 21st of February, Sofles – Graffiti Mapped premiered at Melbourne’s 
                    largest cultural festival, White Night Melbourne. Attended by over 
                    500,000 people and running from 7pm – 7am, 
                    the festival takes over Melbourne’s CBD for a one night only artistic extravaganza.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many months in the making, Sofles – Graffiti Mapped is an innovative step forward 
                    for the world of graffiti and technology.  Sofles – Graffiti Mapped explores 
                    the intrinsic connection between graffiti, street art and technology through 
                    a combination of 3D video mapping, traditional street art and graffiti techniques and motion design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over 5 stories high, Sofles’ inner city mural is his biggest work to date. 
                    Add to that Grant Osborne’s incredibly detailed motion design and 
                    a musical score by New Zealand music producer Opiuo, and you have a truly innovative work of art. 
                    Visible for one night only, but destined to leave an impression on the city’s skyline Sofles - Graffiti Mapped was one of the 
                    most exciting events of the entire White Night Melbourne festival.

                    To change the life of cities with the help of monumental painting is the task set by the curators of 
                    the international festival "Urban Morphogenesis", the geographical scope of which this year goes far 
                    beyond the Moscow region.

                    The first site of the international project in 2019 was the New Trekhgorka microdistrict 
                    in Odintsovo near Moscow. During the pandemic and the global global lockdown 2020, 
                    a group of Russian muralists formed a recognizable visual environment of a typical high-rise 
                    neighborhood of Akadem Riverside in Chelyabinsk. Spring and summer of this year should be a period of 
                    cardinal changes for Solnechnodolsk, to develop an individual look for the neighborhoods of 
                    Kazan and Nizhny Novgorod.

                    Modern art in our time is becoming a powerful tool for the formation of new tourist spaces and 
                    the transformation of familiar gray neighborhoods into bright spots on the map of the country. 
                    Creating a fundamentally new identity for single-industry towns of the "Soviet model" and 
                    modern multi-storey "millionaires", domestic artists and stars of the world graffiti and mural 
                    art clearly prove this within the framework of the Cultural Code project
